# 👋🏻 Hi! I'm Samantha Nadler (she/her)!
### 👩🏻‍💻 Junior at Hofstra University studying Computer Science and Mathematics <br> 🏀 Aspiring Sports Data Scientist
Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will share some awesome projects in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning!

I've been interested in data science since my senior year of high school, after I declared a "double major" in computer science and mathematics (it's really a singular academic program that behaves like a double major). I'm always teaching myself new skills in data science to build on my foundational knowledge from the [Break Through Tech AI Program](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/), which I participated in during the 2024-2025 school year. I'd love to work in sports analytics and use my data science skills on one of my favorite teams!

I hope you enjoy my projects and consider putting me on your data science or machine learning radar!

## What I'm Currently Working On
### ⚾ [60-Day Baseball Analytics Challenge](https://github.com/sknadler/60-day-baseball-analytics-challenge)
Language(s) used: Python<br>
Software(s) used: Jupyter Notebook

For a 60-day period between August 2025 and October 2025, I am challenging myself to create five baseball analytics-related Python projects that combine data analytics with machine learning in a field that I am so passionate about. The following are brief descriptions of each project.

- **[Does the Home Run Derby Affect a Batter's Swing?](https://github.com/sknadler/60-day-baseball-analytics-challenge/tree/main/1.%20Does%20the%20Home%20Run%20Derby%20Affect%20a%20Batter's%20Swing%3F):** There has been plenty of discourse among baseball writers whether or not participating in the Home Run Derby harms a batter's swing, with many recent arguments against the existence of a "Home Run Derby curse." This project analyzes the batting performances of the eight participants of the 2024 Home Run Derby between season halves by creating a novel Statcast-like metric, the Post-Break Performance Index (PBPI), and visualizing trends in each batter's at-bat outcomes, plate discipline, and swing kinematics.
- **Replicating Rapsodo: Classifying Pitches with Kinematic Data:** Pitch-tracking technologies were introduced to MLB stadiums in 2008 as a means of streamlining the pitch tagging and classification process. After the introduction of Statcast in 2015, sensors around the ballpark have begun to measure pitch movement and release point data to improve the robustness of the already-in-place tracking technologies. This project uses a KNeighborsClassifier model to classify over 700,000 pitches from the 2024 MLB season as one of 14 distinct pitch types, achieving a >90% F-1 score. Additionally, this project considers if groups of variables that relate to a pitch's release, velocity, acceleration, movement, and throw data contribute more or less to the overall accuracy of the model and therefore the type of pitch thrown.

### ☠️ Investigating the Transformation and Degradation of 6PPD in Nature
Language(s) used: R<br>
Software(s) used: RStudio

This data analysis is part of an interdisciplinary research project among Hofstra's engineering, chemistry, and computer science departments and investigates how 6PPD (tire antioxidant) transforms and degrades in nature. One of its transformation products, 6PPD-Q, has been known to be incredibly toxic to aquatic organisms. Using a mass spectrometer to analyze results enables us to measure the concentration of chemical compounds using their masses. One exciting part of this project is trying to find new products that have not been seen in the past, and we are planning to use R's patRoon package to analyze these results. This research project will be on applying this R package to our research and is inspired by [Helmus et al.'s (2025)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c09121) journal article "Comprehensive Mass Spectrometry Workflows to Systematically Elucidate Transformation Processes of Organic Micropollutants: A Case Study on the Photodegradation of Four Pharmaceuticals".
