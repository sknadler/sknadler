# 👋🏻 Hi! I'm Samantha Nadler (she/her)!
### 👩🏻‍💻 Third-year student at Hofstra University studying Computer Science and Mathematics <br> 🏟️ Aspiring Sports Data Scientist
Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will share some awesome projects in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning!

I've been interested in data science since my senior year of high school, after I declared a "double major" in computer science and mathematics (it's really a singular academic program that behaves like a double major). I'm always teaching myself new skills in data science to build on my foundational knowledge from the [Break Through Tech AI Program](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/), which I participated in during the 2024-2025 school year. I'd love to work in sports analytics and use my data science skills for a professional sports team or league!

I hope you enjoy my projects and consider putting me on your data science or machine learning radar!

## Project Highlights

### ⚾ [Does the Home Run Derby Affect a Batter's Swing?](https://github.com/sknadler/hrd-analysis)
Languages(s) used: Python<br>
Software(s) used: Jupyter Notebook

There has been plenty of discourse among baseball writers whether or not participating in the Home Run Derby harms a batter's swing, with many recent arguments against the existence of a "Home Run Derby curse." This project analyzes the batting performances of the eight participants of the 2024 Home Run Derby between season halves by creating a novel Statcast-like metric, the Post-Break Performance Index (PBPI), utilizing weighted versions of Batting Average (BA), Slugging Percentage (SLG), and Isolated Power (ISO) to determine positive or negative changes in each batter's offensive production as the season progressed, and visualizing trends in each batter's at-bat outcomes, plate discipline, and swing kinematics.

### 🏥 [Identifying Patient Features Predictive of Emergency Department Use](https://github.com/sknadler/math-138-harmony-healthcare/tree/main/Feature_Selection)
Language(s) used: R<br>
Software(s) used: RStudio

As my final project for MATH 138 (Mathematical Probability and Statistics II) in the spring 2025 semester, I served as a statistical consultant for [Harmony Healthcare](https://www.harmonyhealthcareli.org/), a Long Island-based healthcare provider serving underprivileged communities, with the goal of identifying patient features which would be predictive of whether a patient would use the emergency room. This information is useful for helping to direct patients to earlier interventions with better outcomes and at a lower cost than using the emergency department. My team was responsible for taking a cleaned version of the raw data and using LASSO regression to determine which factors were most determinant of a patient's decision to readmit themself to the emergency department, then when sent to the validation team, measured a .695 AUC metric on just the selected features.

### 🧢 [Analyzing Player Performance of MLB Silver Slugger Award Finalists](https://github.com/sknadler/batting-trends-in-silver-sluggers)
Language(s) used: Python<br>
Software(s) used: Jupyter Notebook

This project is a submission to the [Connecticut Sports Analytics Symposium's (CSAS) 2025 Data Challenge](https://statds.org/events/csas2025/challenge.html), open to any project that uses 2024 Statcast data to analyze some aspect of MLB at-bats during the 2024 season. I decided to focus on comparing batting trends of the three National League shortstop finalists for the 2024 Silver Slugger Award (winner Francisco Lindor and finalists Elly De La Cruz and Willy Adames), performing an exploratory data analysis on seen pitch distributions and pitch strike zone locations, expected batting average and slugging percentage, and exit velocity and launch angles, determining that of the three finalists, Lindor seemed to see the lowest amount of variance in the pitches he saw and therefore had the greatest plate power. The analysis suggested that while raw physical metrics (exit velocity or launch angle) are critical, consistency in plate discipline and pitch-type recognition were more highly correlated with Silver Slugger outcomes in this specific cohort.
