# 👋🏻 Hi! I'm Samantha Nadler (she/her)!
### 👩🏻‍💻 Junior at Hofstra University studying Computer Science and Mathematics <br> ⚾ Aspiring Data Scientist and Sports Analytics Enthusiast
Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will share some awesome projects in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning!

I've been interested in data science since my senior year of high school, after I declared a "double major" in computer science and mathematics (it's really a singular academic program that behaves like a double major). I'm always teaching myself new skills in data science to build on my foundational knowledge from the [Break Through Tech AI Program](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/), which I am participating in during the 2024-2025 school year. I'd love to work in sports analytics and use my data science skills on one of my favorite teams!

I hope you enjoy my projects and consider putting me on your data science or machine learning radar!

## 🛠️ Skill Set
- <b>Programming Languages:</b> Python, R, Java, JavaScript, C++, SQL, HTML/CSS, LaTeX
- <b>Tools and Technologies:</b> Git/GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, Linux, RStudio, Microsoft Office, Power BI

## What I'm Currently Working On
### 👯‍♀️ Critical Vulnerabilities in Machine Learning Classifiers Susceptible to Adversarial Doppelganger Attacks
Language(s) used: Python<br>
Software(s) used: Visual Studio Code, Google Colab

This project aims to address critical vulnerabilities in machine learning (ML) classifiers, which are susceptible to adversarial doppelganger (AD) attacks, AD attacks occur when classifiers assign different labels to inputs or stimuli that are indistinguishable to humans. Significant efforts within the ML research community have been devoted to mitigating this vulnerability through robust training, salience-based training, and accuracy-robustness tradeoffs.
