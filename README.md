# 👋🏻 Hi! I'm Samantha Nadler (she/her)!
### 👩🏻‍💻 Third-year student at Hofstra University studying Computer Science and Mathematics <br> 🏟️ Aspiring Sports Data Scientist
Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will share some awesome projects in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning!

I've been interested in data science since my senior year of high school, after I declared a "double major" in computer science and mathematics (it's really a singular academic program that behaves like a double major). I'm always teaching myself new skills in data science to build on my foundational knowledge from the [Break Through Tech AI Program](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/), which I participated in during the 2024-2025 school year. I'd love to work in sports analytics and use my data science skills on one of my favorite teams!

I hope you enjoy my projects and consider putting me on your data science or machine learning radar!

- **Relevant Coursework:** Probability and Statistics, Statistical Learning, Linear Algebra, Text Mining, Foundations of Data Science (Spring 2026), Software Engineering (Spring 2026)

## Project Highlights

### ⚾ Does the Home Run Derby Affect a Batter's Swing?
Languages(s) used: Python<br>
Software(s) used: Jupyter Notebook

There has been plenty of discourse among baseball writers whether or not participating in the Home Run Derby harms a batter's swing, with many recent arguments against the existence of a "Home Run Derby curse." This project analyzes the batting performances of the eight participants of the 2024 Home Run Derby between season halves by creating a novel Statcast-like metric, the Post-Break Performance Index (PBPI), utilizing weighted versions of Batting Average (BA), Slugging Percentage (SLG), and Isolated Power (ISO) to determine positive or negative changes in offensive production, and visualizing trends in each batter's at-bat outcomes, plate discipline, and swing kinematics.

### 🏥 [Identifying Patient Features Predictive of Emergency Department Use](https://github.com/sknadler/math-138-harmony-healthcare/tree/main/Feature_Selection)
Language(s) used: R<br>
Software(s) used: RStudio

As my final project for MATH 138 (Mathematical Probability and Statistics II) in the spring 2025 semester, I served as a statistical consultant for [Harmony Healthcare](https://www.harmonyhealthcareli.org/), a Long Island-based healthcare provider serving underprivileged communities, with the goal of identifying patient features which would be predictive of whether a patient would use the emergency room. This information is useful for helping to direct patients to earlier interventions with better outcomes and at a lower cost than using the emergency department. My team was responsible for taking a cleaned version of the raw data and using LASSO regression to determine which factors were most determinant of a patient's decision to readmit themself to the emergency department, then when sent to the validation team, measured a .695 AUC metric on just the selected features.

### 🧢 Analyzing Player Performance of MLB Silver Slugger Award Finalists
Language(s) used: Python<br>
Software(s) used: Jupyter Notebook

This data analysis is part of an interdisciplinary research project among Hofstra's engineering, chemistry, and computer science departments and investigates how 6PPD (tire antioxidant) transforms and degrades in nature. One of its transformation products, 6PPD-Q, has been known to be incredibly toxic to aquatic organisms. Using a mass spectrometer to analyze results enables us to measure the concentration of chemical compounds using their masses. One exciting part of this project is trying to find new products that have not been seen in the past, and we are planning to use R's patRoon package to analyze these results. This research project will be on applying this R package to our research and is inspired by [Helmus et al.'s (2025)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c09121) journal article "Comprehensive Mass Spectrometry Workflows to Systematically Elucidate Transformation Processes of Organic Micropollutants: A Case Study on the Photodegradation of Four Pharmaceuticals".
