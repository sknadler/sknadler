# 👋🏻 Hi! I'm Samantha Nadler (she/her)!
### 👩🏻‍💻 Junior at Hofstra University studying Computer Science and Mathematics <br> ⚾ Aspiring Data Scientist and Sports Analytics Enthusiast
Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will share some awesome projects in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning!

I've been interested in data science since my senior year of high school, after I declared a "double major" in computer science and mathematics (it's really a singular academic program that behaves like a double major). I'm always teaching myself new skills in data science to build on my foundational knowledge from the [Break Through Tech AI Program](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/), which I am participating in during the 2024-2025 school year. I'd love to work in sports analytics and use my data science skills on one of my favorite teams!

I hope you enjoy my projects and consider putting me on your data science or machine learning radar!

## 🛠️ Skill Set
- <b>Programming Languages:</b> Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, R, SQL, HTML/CSS, LaTeX
- <b>Tools and Technologies:</b> Git/GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, Linux, RStudio, Microsoft Office, Power BI

## What I'm Currently Working On
### 🏥 [Understanding Trends in Emergency Room Visits](https://github.com/sknadler/math-138-harmony-healthcare) (with Harmony Healthcare Long Island)
Language(s) used: R<br>
Software(s) used: RStudio, Excel

This project uses data collected over a one-week period from a Long Island healthcare clinic. The goal of the project is to identify which variables are most predictive of a patient using the emergency room in order to develop strategies to decrease unnecessary emergency room visits either by education or other interventions.
